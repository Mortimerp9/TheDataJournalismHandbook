The Data Journalism Handbook
============================

The Data Journalism Handbook was born at a 48 hour workshop at MozFest 2011 in London. It subsequently spilled over into an international, collaborative effort involving dozens of data journalism’s leading advocates and best practitioners.

In the 6 months that passed between the book’s inception to its first full release, hundreds of people have contributed in various ways. While we have done our best to keep track of them all, we have had our fair share of anonymous, pseudonymous and untraceable edits.

To all of those people who have contributed and are not listed below, we say two things. Firstly, thank you. Secondly, can please tell us who you are so that we can give credit where credit is due.

Authors
-------

This book has been created by many contributors and edited by Jonathan Gray, Lucy Chambers, Wilfried Ruetten and Liliana Bounegru. I am not the author of any part of this book and have just created this repository to help people access other formats of this great handbook and read it on the go.

The GitHub Mirror
-----------------

The Data Journalism Handbook has [its official home](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/) where you can find the latest version, translations and buy ebook and physical copies of the book through [O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025603.do).

This github repository is a mirror of the beta 1.0 version that makes it easy to download it for local viewing on your computer and printing if you like cutting trees. It also provides a conversion to the Kindle (MOBI) format and to PDF.

Any help in maintaining this repository is welcome, if you want to provide corrections or other formats to download, let me know.

Conversion
==========

For the moment, the handbook is available here in four different formats:
 * The [original layout](http://pierreandrews.net/TheDataJournalismHandbook/splithtml/1.0/en/) from the official home in html, with one section per page.
 * A [one page HTML version](http://pierreandrews.net/TheDataJournalismHandbook/onefilehtml/1.0/en/), with all the chapters and sections on the same page.
 * An automatic conversion of this HTML to two major ebook formats: [EPub](https://github.com/Mortimerp9/TheDataJournalismHandbook/raw/master/TheDataJournalismHandbook.epub) and [Mobi for Kindle](https://github.com/Mortimerp9/TheDataJournalismHandbook/raw/master/TheDataJournalismHandbook.mobi), using [Calibre](calibre-ebook.com).
 * A [PDF printout](https://github.com/Mortimerp9/TheDataJournalismHandbook/raw/master/TheDataJournalismHandbook.pdf) of this HTML.

The single page HTML makes it easy for you to download the book and read it offline on your computer. O'Reilly publishes copy edited and formatted editions of this book, in physical copies and in ebook format, they will be better formatted than the current Kindle and PDF version available here.
